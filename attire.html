                            The people are to work hours in the sun and move around from one place to the other. Thus
                            people
                            preferred to wear what made them able to move around freely and feel comfortable.

                    </strong>
                    <div>The men in Maharashtra usually we a dhoti. A dhoti is a single piece
                        of cloth that is tucked around one's waist, and it covers the entire leg till the ankle.
                        Dhotis are secured by making five tucks on each side, and then the loose ends are put in at
                        the back. Dhotis are usually saffron or cream or white in colour. Dhotis are an unstitched
                        piece of clothing that do not require any proper measurements as one could make it however
                        tight or loose they wished it to be.Dhoti is suited for almost all seasons. The reason is that
                        they
                        are available in both silk and
                        cotton fabrics. The silk varieties are embraced in the traditional customs and marriages, while
                        the
                        cotton ones are worn as daily wear.

                    </strong>
                    <div>During the war times, just to showcase their calibre and to strengthen their physical
                        capabilities, Marathi women invented this dhoti like saree draping style. The ancient Marathi
                        women wanted to accompany their husbands and fathers to fight against foreign intruders.The
                        saree is tucked in the
                        middle giving it a similar look to the dhoti. The rest of the saree is wrapped around the
                        upper body of the women. This type of saree is usually called Lugad. The most sought after
                        Marathi saree is the "in vogue" Paithani silk saree (looks best in Pheswai style draping).
                        Kholapuri silk saree is the most commonly worn saree in Marathi culture( looks best with dhoti
                        drape, the contemporary one) and then there is Banarasi silk saree, the royal silk saree along
                        with Uppada silk saree.

                    </strong>
                    <div>Pheta is the headdress Marathi men wear. It is a 'topi', or a head
                        cover usually made up of cotton. Pheta, also known as pagris are small hats that are made to
                        cover the heads so as to protect them from the direct sun rays falling on their heads.
                        Travellers and people working outside, under the sun especially wear this. By preventing the
                        direct sun rays, the individual does not feel drained or tired too quickly or easily.Other than
                        the traditional white and Saffron encrusted Pheta, there are two major varieties available. One
                        is the famous Kolhapuri Pheta, which comes in a multitude of colors and has a Bandhani effect on
                        it. There are different styles of draping a Pheta that is determined by the nature of the place
                        or the location and even famous personalities. For instance, if we take the example of places,
                        there are styles like the Kolhapuri style, Mawali style, Puneri style, Lahiri style and many
                        more.</div>

                    <div>The Maharashtrian women wear choli or blouse underneath the saree. It
                        is the 'top' or shirt that they wear to cover their upper body. The choli covers half of the
                        torso. the blouses are short, or half sleeved that have hooks in the front making it easier
                        for the women to wear them. Similar to men's clothing, women's clothing is also made up of
                        cotton and sometimes of silk. Because of this it can be worn in any season. The commonly found
                        colours in Maharashtrian sarees are green and
                        red and sometimes even Kesari (yellow) colour.

                    </strong>
                    <div>Maharashtrian men usually wear cotton tops or Kurtas above their dhoti. The tops are made up of
                        cotton so as to able the garment to absorb sweat since Maharashtra has a warm to a hot
                        environment. These tops are thin and loose, generally white in colour.
                        A number of modifications have been introduced these last few years to improve the look of the
                        Kurta by literally transforming this garment to the way you would like it. You can have
                        embroidery, buttons of different styles on a Kurta to make it look more graceful. You can remove
                        the sleeves, reduce the length of the sleeves or even include a stand up collar to improve the
                        appearance of the Kurta.A Kurta can also be used on a number of occasions. Sometimes it is
                        classified as a wedding Kurta, Reception Kurta or even a party Kurta when it contains appealing
                        embroidery work. The best Kurtas are commonly used as an outfit for everyday life as a simple
                        version because of the comfort it provides to the wearer.

                        Jewelry has been a significant adornment for Indian women for ages. The tradition of adorning
                        oneself with jewelry might be thousands of years old but has always remained in fashion till
                        date. They are considered to be one of the supreme symbols of Femininity and very auspicious in
                        Hindu Culture in India. Jewelry not only helps in enhancing one’s beauty but also symbolizes
                        wealth, power, and status. For some, jewelry is also a form of art for self and creative
                        expression.

                        Women wear nath i.e. a nose piercing. Naths can be simple loops or loops connected with the
                        earring on any one side. They are normally made up of gold. Women are also found wearing other
                        gold jewellery like earrings and necklace (haar) with different coloured stones.Married women
                        wear mangal sutra and also green bangles. The bride wears green bangles as they are said to
                        bring prosperity to the relationship and family.

                            of cloth that is tucked around one's waist, and it covers the entire leg till the ankle.
                            Dhotis are secured by making five tucks on each side, and then the loose ends are put in at
                            the back. Dhotis are usually saffron or cream or white in colour. Dhotis are an unstitched
                            piece of clothing that do not require any proper measurements as one could make it however
                            tight or loose they wished it to be.

                            cover usually made up of cotton. Pehta, also known as pagris are small hats that are made to
                            cover the heads so as to protect them from the direct sun rays falling on their heads.
                            Travellers and people working outside, under the sun especially wear this. By preventing the
                            direct sun rays, the individual does not feel drained or tired too quickly or easily.

                            is a sleeveless jacket or coat. They are worn above their shirts. Bandi made the
                            Maharashtrian attire look more formal and proper. Bandis are more pragmatic keeping in mind
                            the climate of Maharashtra which did not allow men to wear normal coats or overcoats due to
                            the excessive warmth.

                        <p class="text-muted mb-0">Women wear sarees that are 9 yards long. The saree is tucked in the
                            middle giving it a similar look to the dhoti. The rest of the saree is wrapped around the
                            upper body of the women. This type of saree is usually called Lugade. There were many
                            variations in how women wear their saree. Some only wear knee length sarees. Some wear it in
                            a skirt manner without the tuck in the middle. But the 9-yard saree is the traditional
                            costume of women in Maharashtra.

                        <p class="text-muted mb-0">The Maharashtrian women wear choli or blouse underneath the saree. It
                            is the 'top' or shirt that they wear to cover their upper body. The choli covers half of the
                            torso. the blouses are short, or half sleeved that have hooks in the front making it easier
                            for the women to wear them. Similar to men's clothing, women's clothing is also made up of
                            cotton and sometimes of silk. The commonly found colours in Maharashtrian sarees are green
                            and red and sometimes even Kesari (yellow) colour.

                            said to have a nerve that is connected to the uterus and elements from the ring are said to
                            make the uterus strong).
