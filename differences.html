            <h3 class="mb-3">The headbob</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">head wobble, or Indian head shake refers to a common gesture found in South Asian
              cultures, most notably in India. The motion usually consists of a side-to-side tilting of the head in
              arcs. A head bobble can have a variety of different meaning Most frequently it means
              yes, or is used to indicate understanding. The meaning of the head bobble depends on the context of the
              conversation or encounter. It can serve as an alternative to thank you, as a polite introduction, or it
              can represent acknowledgement. It may take time getting used to but it will become part of your life then.

            <h3 class="mb-3">Intrusive Questions</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Indians are really inquisitive people and their culture is one where people do
              anything but mind their own business, often due to a lack of privacy in India and the habit of placing
              people in the social hierarchy. As a result, don't be surprised or offended if someone asks you how much
              you earn for a living and a host of other intimate questions, all upon first meeting. What's more, you
              should feel free to ask these type of questions in return. Rather than causing offense, the people you are
              conversing with will be pleased that you've taken such an interest in them!

            <h3 class="mb-3">Lack of punctuality</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0"> Many Indians, when finalising a time to meet with someone arent generlaly on
              time. It is understood that the other person may be late. This ranges anywhere from 5 minutes to as long
              as 30 minutes. When booking appointments with people to meet in India expect them to be late more often
              than not. In the west, it's considered rude to be late, and anything more than 10 minutes requires a phone
              call. In India, the concept of time is flexible. People are unlikely to turn up when they say they will.
              10 minutes can mean half an hour, half an hour can mean an hour, and an hour can mean indefinitely!</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">Dont point your feet at people</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Feet are considered to be unclean and therefore it's important to avoid pointing
              your feet at people or touching people or objects (particularly books) with your feet or shoes. If you
              accidentally do so, you should apologize straight away. Also, note that Indians will often touch their
              head or eyes as a show of apology. On the other hand, it's a sign of respect to bend down and touch an
              elder person's feet in India.

              Pointing with your finger is also rude in India. If you need to point at something or someone, it's better
              to do so with your whole hand or thumb.

            <h3 class="mb-3">DONT Always be Polite</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0">The use of "please" and "thank you" are essential for good manners in western
              culture. However, in India, they can create unnecessary formality and, surprisingly, can even be
              insulting! While it's fine to thank someone who has provided a service to you, lavishing thanks on friends
              or family should be avoided. Another thing to keep in mind is
              that being polite can be viewed as a sign of weakness in India, especially if someone is trying to scam or
              exploit you. A meek, "No, thank you", is rarely enough to deter touts and street vendors. Instead, it's
              necessary to be more stern and forceful.

            <h3 class="mb-3">Dont wear shoes inside</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-0"> It's good manners to take your shoes off before entering someone's home, and
              it's a prerequisite before entering a temple or mosque. Indians will often wear shoes inside their homes,
              such as when going to the bathroom. However, these shoes are kept for domestic use and never worn
              outdoors. Shoes are sometimes also removed before entering a shop. If you see shoes at an entrance, it's a
              good idea to take yours off as well. Indians have been trained from their childhood to take off their
              shoes when entering someone's home. That's because those shoes they wear everywhere are covered in more
              bacteria than a toilet seat. </p>
