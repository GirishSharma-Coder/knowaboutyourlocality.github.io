              Pune exemplifies an indigenous Marathi culture and ethos, in which education, arts and crafts, and
              theatres are given due prominence. It is the birthplace of the poet-saint Tukaram (in Dehu) and
              Jnaneshvara (in Alandi), the author of the well-known commentary ‘Jnaneshwari’,on the “Bhagavad Gita”. It
              is the home of great freedom fighters like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Agarkar and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Jayant
              Narlikar, the famous contemporary scientist, is from Pune. Pune is the seat of North Indian Classical
              music. Annually, in the month of December, it hosts a three nightlong cultural program of vocal and
              instrumental classical music, called “Savai-Gandharva”.Pune has been an example for the blending of the
              culture and heritage with modernisation and its side effects. Pune is the cultural capital of the
              Maharashtra.

      <h3>Maghi Sankranti (January)</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-12 text-center" style="margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px; width:90%;">

      The prime reason people celebrate Makar Sankranti is to thank the sun god. It is the day when the sun heads
      northwards towards the Tropic of Cancer and on the day of the festival, the night and day time become equal. Makar
      Sankranti is also to welcome warmer days as it marks the end of winter solstice. It is also the first day of the
      new month of Magha and people wake up early to soak in the sun rays as these are full of Vitamin D.
      The state celebrates Makar Sankranti by exchanging sweets made of sesame seeds and jaggery or as they call it
      til-gul laddo0. They also wish each other on the day and with this gesture, they strive to keep their friendship
      alive for the rest of the year. Even if you have some issues, this is the day to forget and forgive by exchanging
      these sweet treats. There is a saying that goes ’til gul ghya, god-god bola’ that translates to ‘have these sweets
      and speak in a sweet manner’ as the sweetness of it will dissolve all the negativity and sourness of the
      relationship. Along with this, people also make puran poli which is a flat bread stuffed with jaggery and gram
      flour in it with pure ghee. All these are good for the body as during winter, the body needs food items to keep
      one warm and also to provide the necessary moisture. The ingredients in these dishes work well for the body.

      <h3>Vasant Panchami (February)</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-12 text-center" style="margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px; width:90%;">

      Basant Panchami also called Madana Panchmi and Saraswati Puja is celebrated to worship Goddess Saraswati – the
      deity of learning and knowledge and also to mark
      the beginning of spring season. A prayer or a ritual ceremony is often organised in the schools and other
      educational institutes on the eve of Basant Panchami. Yellow is the dominant color during Basant panchmi and the
      main reason for yellow being the dominant colour of
      Basant Panchami is said to be that the occasion is being celebrated at a time when bright yellow flowers of the
      ripe mustard plants can be spotted in the fields of rural India. Also, several flowers of this season are yellow
      including marigold, daffodils etc. which are being offered to the Goddess Saraswati.

      <h3>Pola celebrations in Pune (August)</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-12 text-center" style="margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px; width:90%;">

      Pola festival has its own traditional rituals to be followed like bulls are given a bath and then decorated with
      jewellery, shawls and a garland of flowers. They are even painted in various colours and then worshiped. The whole
      process consists of decorating them accompanied by music and dancing. The main task of this festival is the old
      bullock is tied with a wooden frame on its horns and it is are made to break a rope of mango leaves that is tied
      between two posts.Pola teaches every human being to respect animals and there is an assumption that on this day
      the sky looks as if wheat floor is spread all over. That’s the reason why this festival is also called as Pithori
      Amavasya. And as soon as this festival gets over activities like sowing and ploughing take place.

      <h3>Ganesh Festival (August-September)</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-12 text-center" style="margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px; width:90%;">

      Ganpati Mahotsav or Ganesh Festival was a regional event initiated by Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1894 to
      bring the local community together for the Independence Movement. A 10-day celebration festival, Ganpati Mahotsav
      starts with bringing the idol of Lord Ganesha to home and ends with its immersion in the river amidst a huge gala
      procession accompanied with people singing and dancing to the joy of their heart over a span of 11 days.It is
      believed that devotees who pray to Ganesha are able to fulfil their wishes and desires. So, the main essence of
      Ganesh Chaturthi is that devotees who pray to him are set free of sins and it leads them on the path of knowledge
      and wisdom.

      <h3>Diwali in Pune (October-November)</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-12 text-center" style="margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px; width:90%;">

      Diwali is celebrated in Pune just the way it is done in other parts of the country. People decorate their houses
      with rangoli (designs made of powdered dry colours), candles, diyas (earthen lamps), colourful kandils (paper
      lanterns) and flowers. People also buy new things, prepare mouth-watering dishes, meet friends and families and
      play with fire crackers. Diwali is celebrated on the return of Lord Ram to Ayodhya following his 14 years of exile
      and after defeating the demon king Ravana. During this exile, the wicked king Ravana of Lanka abducted Sita. After
      a lot of hurdles and a lengthy quest, Lord Rama finally vanquished Lanka and saved Sita. In joyous celebration of
      this victory and the return of King Rama, the people of Ayodhya rejoiced by illuminating the kingdom with earthen
      diyas, distributing sweets and by setting off firecrackers, a tradition still followed by myriad people who
      celebrate the festival.
      Most of the Hindu people worship Goddess Lakshmi on Diwali, considering her as a goddess of prosperity and wealth.
      The day is marked as the birthday of this deity which was the New Moon day of the Karthik month. Utterly impressed
      by the serene beauty of Lakshmi, Lord Vishnu decided to marry her and, therefore, the diyas were illuminated in a
      row to mark this occasion. Since then Diwali is celebrated to worship Goddess Lakshmi and seek her blessings.
